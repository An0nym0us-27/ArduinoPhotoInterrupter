# ArduinoPhotoInterrupter

The purpose of this project is to implement a photo-interrupter on the Aruduino uno.

The photo-interrupter is triggered when it detects an object.
If an object is detected, it will enable the on-board LED.
If nothing is detected, it will wait until it is triggered and the on-board LED will stay off.
